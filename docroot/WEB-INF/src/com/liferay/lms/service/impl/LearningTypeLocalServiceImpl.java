/**
 * The implementation of the learning type local service.
 *
 * <p>
 * All custom service methods should be put in this class. Whenever methods are added, rerun ServiceBuilder to copy their definitions into the {@link com.liferay.lms.service.LearningTypeLocalService} interface.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. Always use {@link com.liferay.lms.service.LearningTypeLocalServiceUtil} to access the learning type local service.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a local service. Methods of this service will not have security checks based on the propagated JAAS credentials because this service can only be accessed from within the same VM.
